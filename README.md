## üìä Analytics Setup

To query analytics data from your Cloudflare Analytics Engine:

1. Get your Cloudflare Account ID from the [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com/)
2. Create an API token with "Account Analytics Read" permissions
3. Set environment variables:
   ```bash
   export CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID="your_account_id"
   export CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN="your_api_token"
   ```

4. Run queries:
   ```bash
   # Get summary of last 24 hours
   ./query-analytics.sh summary
   
   # Get contact form submissions (last 7 days)
   ./query-analytics.sh contact
   
   # Get geographic distribution
   ./query-analytics.sh countries
   
   # Get error statistics
   ./query-analytics.sh errors
   
   # Get performance metrics (last hour)
   ./query-analytics.sh performance
   ```

5. For security best practices, you can also use a .env file:
   ```bash
   # Create .env file in project root
   echo 'CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID="your_account_id"' > .env
   echo 'CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN="your_api_token"' >> .env
   
   # Source the environment variables
   source .env
   
   # Or run queries with environment variables set inline
   CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID="your_account_id" CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN="your_api_token" ./query-analytics.sh summary
   ```
